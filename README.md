# RonApi & RonAi Core
This project aims to add Ai opponents to the Reign of Nether mod.
- [Curse Forge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reign-of-nether-rts-in-minecraft)
- [Github repository](https://github.com/SoLegendary/reignofnether)

This project consists of:
- An abstraction layer to manipulate the Reign of Nether codebase like a pure RTS solution instead of a minecraft mod (RonApi add-on)
- An RTS AI framework, fine-tuned for Reign of Nether data, build on top of the RonApi (RoNAi Core add-on)
  - In case of drastic changes to the RoN codebase, only the RonApi will need to be updated to accommodate changes

## RonApi features
### THIS WILL BE MOVED TO A SEPARATE PROJECT LATER
- Timers: utilities to run code after delays
- TypeIds: abstracting building/units/abilities/orders as int values
- World tracking: wrappers and utilities for easier manipulation of the RTS simulation
  - Resource - gradually scan chunks to detect resource block, and agglomerate blocks into resource nodes
  - Player - aggregate the units and structures for each player, as well as resources and other information
  - Unit - simplify unit manipulation
  - Building - simplify building manipulation
